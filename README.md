# Project Description

This project was to create a very visually appealing letterhead template using advanced CSS techniques, and a Lorem Ipsum generator for text.

## Running the Website

1. To run everything you will need to Fork or Clone this repository and open in up in an IDE on your local PC or in VS Codespaces.

2. Once you have cloned the Repo, open it up in VS Code.

3. Select the index.html file from the Explorer Window.

4. Then, using the VS Code Command Palette, type: > Live Preview Start Server. If this command is not available, you may need to install the VS Code Live Preview extension.

5. This will open up a website preview within your IDE. You can also open this in an external browser if you choose, by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines icon to the top right of the preview window and selecting 'Open in Browser'.

6. Feel free to test the responsive layout by changing the size of your browser!


## Sources and Credits
I used a lot of previous knowledge in playing around with this one. That may have made it more difficult as I tried to accomplish things with that I know versus using new items that were covered in the reading that would have made this much easier/more efficient. I hope to review some of the previous weeks reading in addition to the next modules content and get caught up soon as work should slow down in the next week or two.

Text was taken directly from the Lorem Ipsum generator (and some code examples were used as reference points although nothing was copied exactly.)
