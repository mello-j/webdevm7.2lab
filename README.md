# Project Description

This project was to work with advanced CSS to style a page in a visually appealing format using different advanced CSS techniques.

## Running the Website

1. To run everything you will need to Fork or Clone this repository and open in up in an IDE on your local PC or in VS Codespaces.

2. Once you have cloned the Repo, open it up in VS Code.

3. Select the index.html file from the Explorer Window.

4. Then, using the VS Code Command Palette, type: > Live Preview Start Server. If this command is not available, you may need to install the VS Code Live Preview extension.

5. This will open up a website preview within your IDE. You can also open this in an external browser if you choose, by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines icon to the top right of the preview window and selecting 'Open in Browser'.

6. Feel free to test the responsive layout by changing the size of your browser!


## Sources and Credits
I used a lot of previous knowledge in playing around with this one. I have a little experience with Flexbox (used in Lab 4 to create a VERY similar layout), and decided to use it initially to just complete the lab. 

The readings did add some additional knowledge on flexbox, and on using float to handle the text nicely (particularly how the margins work with float.)
